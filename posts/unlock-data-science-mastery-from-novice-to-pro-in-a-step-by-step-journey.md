## Steps to Mastering Data Science

### Step 1:- Learn Python programming language

Initializing one statistical programming language like Python is critical for data scientists. Python offers open-source and freely available solutions that allow for easy data editing, analysis, and presentation. Most data scientists prefer Python, which can handle any data analysis and is simple to understand.</br>

Beginners can learn this language as it offers syntax similar to natural language. It is helpful in many use cases. Some common Python use cases are creating web applications, automation, data analysis, and data science.</br>

### Step 2:- Learn applied mathematics 

Mathematics in data science refers to understanding the problem and trying various methods to get the desired result. Mathematical concepts such as probability, linear algebra, vector geometry, and statistics are vital. They help grasp deep learning and machine learning.</br>

### Step 3: Understand SQL (Structured Query Language)

As a data scientist, you will handle projects of varying difficulty. The proper knowledge of SQL can help you store and manage the data correctly. Therefore, SQL knowledge is a must for data scientists. It helps manage and handle data in databases.</br>

Through SQL, you can handle input data, make query schemas, and modify/update/remove data using Python or R. You can even create your codes in SQL. It will help you be more efficient by creating reliable scripts. The best data science online programs offer expert SQL knowledge to learners.</br>

### Step 4: Master machine learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are some popular buzzwords in the industry. ML creates a system capable of learning and improving without any human interference. It means the system can learn from past mistakes and increase efficiency.</br>

Data scientists train models with a particular set of data. The ML algorithms quickly grasp how the model operates. The algorithms function even after it is tested on a dataset. You need programming knowledge and mathematical skills to study machine learning properly.</br>

Most learners prefer to learn ML with Python for easy understanding. They enroll in the best online data science Bootcamp to gain relevant ML knowledge.</br>

### Step 5: Build projects

It would help if you displayed your ability to work with real-world data through a data science project. You can add successful projects to your portfolio to impress the recruiters. Practicing and implementing your knowledge in real-world projects is very helpful in improving your knowledge and skills.</br>

Additionally, Projects acts as a backbone to any course or degree program, here you can add your own ML or Regression based projects. Starting or implementing a project from scratch can help you get a better hold on trending technical ideas, preparing you for better career opportunities.</br>

**Pro-tip: “It is advisable to include a project in your portfolio that is highly relevant to your domain and has a greater presence on various tech websites such as Geek for Geeks or GitHub.”**</br>
