<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">Must-Have Machine Learning Skills You Need in Your Toolkit!</span>

Everything around us nowadays is becoming more and more dependent on complex technologies. If you don’t have adequate knowledge and training in data science these days, it may be tough to keep up with the competition. Everybody is looking to upgrade themselves with these new and complex technologies.</br>

One area where your knowledge will be sufficiently enhanced is machine learning (ML). In brief, machine learning is a subdivision of artificial intelligence. <b>Mastering machine learning</b> and its applications can quickly make you a competent professional.</br>

ML is constantly advancing the surrounding environment through its applications, from smartphone cameras to Google Maps and self-driving cars. Most of our daily tasks are slowly becoming automated as ML integrates. Hence, learning the basics and mastering yourself in trending technologies is a must.</br>

But what skill do you require to master these trending technologies in data science? You need a mix of the <b>technical skills required for data scientist</b> roles and soft skills to work efficiently in an office setting. We’ll go over the essential <b>data science skills</b> in the list below.</br></br>

## Technical skills

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/master-ml-one.png" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An image suggested the use of technical skills in Data modelling, NLP etc."/></br>

Being a data scientist demands a list of technical proficiencies you must showcase. Let’s have a look at the most essential tech skills.</br>

### 1.  Applied Mathematics

Mathematics is an important part of machine learning. You must have mathematics knowledge and specialize in some parts of math. Math helps a data scientist in these concepts.</br>

- Finding the correct algorithm for your needs</br>
- Assessing the confidence intervals</br>
- Determining validation plans</br>
- Using parameters</br>

Depending on your level of knowledge and proficiency in math, you may give importance to this skill. You need familiarity with probability theory and statistics, information theory, linear algebra, and calculus.</br>

### 2. Data Modeling and Evaluation

As a data scientist, you have to work with large datasets and use them in predictive analytics. Your data modeling and evaluation knowledge will come in handy with these large datasets. It also helps evaluate the performance of the final machine-learning model. These concepts must be learned for data modeling and evaluation.</br>

- Classification Accuracy</br>
- Mean Squared Error</br>
- Confusion Matrix</br>
- Area under Curve</br>
- Mean Absolute Error</br>
- F1 Score</br>
- Logarithmic Loss</br>

### 3. Neural network

Neural networks help execute ML tasks with the help of a set of already-defined algorithms. They provide a class of models that aid in machine learning tasks. The following reasons are why you must be skilled in neural networks as a machine learning enthusiast.</br>

- Neural networks are essential for understanding how the human brain works, based on which we can model artificial neural networks.</br>
- They help you understand sequential and parallel computations.</br>

### 4. Natural language processing (NLP)

Different methods and libraries in machine learning are based on natural language processing. Processes using NLP include emotive or sentiment analysis, digital speech recognition, language translation, and more. They help manage the data of both businesses and individuals.</br>

### 5. Physics

It is a bonus skill that you may have to make it easier to develop complex systems. ML also takes inspiration from statistical physics. Machine learning tools such as maximum entropy and variational inference are based on physics.</br></br>

## Programming skills  

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/master-ml-two.png" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An image shows a laptop running a code with PHP and CSS."/></br>

Machine learning includes writing codes for systems that enable them to complete normal tasks similar to humans. Hence, it involves coding and a knowledge of programming languages. C, C++, Python, MATLAB, and Apache are in-demand programming languages.</br></br>

## Soft skills   

Your soft skills ultimately determine if your technical skills are of any use. Soft skills like problem-solving, communication, and time management are some <b>data scientist required skills</b>.</br>

### 1. Communication

You have to interact with teams within the company and offshore departments as a data scientist. You can develop your communication proficiency to boost your application at the time of interviews. Clients and business partners also interact regularly with data scientists to get an overview of the project’s performance.</br>

### 2. Problem-solving

Normally, solving problems is a part of creating ML models. As a data scientist, you can join teams to work on your problem-solving in a project. Collaborating with others is also a major skill set. Additionally, you can gain problem-solving skills to be helpful in interviews.</br>

### 3. Time management

It takes work to train an ML model. As a machine learning enthusiast, you may have to showcase some time management abilities. Since you’ll face constant issues and may get stuck in places, it can help you better manage your and your team’s time.</br>

### 4. Domain knowledge

Machine learning is a discipline that is being applied to many industries. Choosing an industry in advance where you can apply your <b>data science skills</b> is an important step toward becoming a proficient data scientist. Hence, you can gather domain knowledge in a specific field where you can specialize to boost your profile.</br></br>
