<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">Industry Defining Data Science Trends 2024 You Should Look Out For!</span>
</br>

<b>Augmented analytics</b> is on trend now. We are living in the ever-expanding digital universe where piles of live data have emerged as the cornerstone of success for any industry. Within a nanosecond, an immense volume of data is born, shaping the industries and driving prodigious changes in business operations. Due to these, industries are facing critical challenges.

But why so?

Well, as the data keeps booming at a novel rate, deriving meaningful insight from such oceans of data is not a walk in the park. So, upskilling with the latest data trends is now like a strategic necessity rather than an option to thrive in the competitive market. And here comes the need for augmented data scientists.

_<b>But first, you need to understand the basic terminology of “what is Augmented analytics”?</b>_

## Augmented analytics

Advanced-level data analysis can be a daunting task for professionals across industries if they don’t have adequate knowledge of data science. Augmented analytics works as the simplifier that bridges the gap between unstructured data and actionable insights.

At the initial stage data analytics needed exclusive expertise for profitable insight generation. In fact, it used to be a bit difficult to hire a batch of expert data scientists or analysts. Augmented analytics has disrupted this paradigm with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation and made the entire analytical workflow super smooth.

For a better understanding, just imagine you have an intelligent helping hand who handles the data collection, filtration, pattern recognition, and analysis seamlessly. <b>Augmented analysis</b> is such a helping hand that works using AI-driven algorithm streamlining processes.

The increasing usage of sophisticated analytical tools helps business leaders and marketers to come up with expert analytical output even with limited knowledge of data science. Hence, we can say that augmented analytics is a transformative force that is shaping the worldwide business landscape.

<b>Similarly, there are more data science trends in 2024 shaping up the industries.</b>

### 1. Big data for analytics

A recent data science trend in industries is big data analytics. Companies that are using big data to perform analysis gain an edge over others. The subset of Big data analytics known as predictive analytics helps in becoming a significant game changer. It helps companies make better decisions by understanding and predicting results.

Predictive analytics assists companies in becoming competitive. Hence, it helps gain new customers while retaining existing ones. New analytics techniques that can process and analyze massive datasets are being introduced. They prove to be of significant help during data-driven decision-making.
