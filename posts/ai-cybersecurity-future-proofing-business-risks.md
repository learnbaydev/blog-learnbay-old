Today’s tech era heavily relies on AI-driven results. Artificial Intelligence (AI) alters the digital space with better ability and higher yields, protecting against numerous security risks. Yet, the rise of <b>artificial intelligence in cyber security</b> turns the game with potent moves. <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/99832-study-finds-increase-in-cybersecurity-attacks-fueled-by-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"></a> finds that around 75% of working pros found a steady rise in cyberattacks in the last year. No wonder, leaders bring a notable change in risk-handling ways with the rise of AI. Still, owing to the increasing cyber threats, leaders must learn secure ways to future-proof cybersecurity with AI.</br>

_<b>Industry case:</b> Here, we can cite a real business case example of <b>Honeywell International, Inc.</b> The company’s ethical use of AI helps it fairly analyze data extracted from industrial control systems. Plus, its AI systems make timely predictions of malicious acts or unusual behavior. Leaders use AI models to detect and limit unethical actions from breaching data records._</br>

_<b>Before this, let’s review how AI helps leaders to future-proof cybersecurity metrics.</b>_

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/cyber-ai.png" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An image shows a man pointing to a cybersecurity symbol to identify accurate technical shifts. "/></br>

## AI on the Verge of Driving the Future of Cybersecurity

Recent years have seen a rapid rise in the number of cyberattacks. This shows a prominent risk that firms encounter when utilising a novel technology. Today’s digital space demands skills to control the wave of advanced tech shifts. Experts must upskill with the latest trends to cope with the changing job demands in cybersecurity or AI roles.</br>

AI takes a radical leap toward digital growth. <b>Enterprise artificial intelligence</b> plays a vital role in the tech age. It extends support to meet firm needs with a fair knowledge of human instincts. It links machine and human thoughts in an interactive form to reach insights. Furthermore, it aims to save firms from external risks such as cyber-attacks.</br>

Traditionally, cybersecurity revolved around primary defense ways with lesser accuracy. Security management ways reflected vital alerts, unusual patterns, or errors with lesser fairness. Fortunately, the rise of AI in cybersecurity aims to deliver fair and correct info on mishappening.</br>

Indeed, the integration of <b>enterprise artificial intelligence</b> in cybersecurity holds a bright future. Yet, the unfair use of AI models can degrade the gains. Experts with no or limited knowledge of AI models can bring certain pitfalls. Cybersecurity revolves around many risks. Plus, the use of AI in cybersecurity displays its double-edged sword feature. AI can be both constructive and destructive, but it depends on the skills of cybersecurity experts. Thus, gaining expertise with an industry-driven AI program can help you overcome pitfalls.</br>

In short, the new regime of cybersecurity depends on AI. Enterprise leaders must future-proof cybersecurity methods with an ethical use of AI. As stated earlier, AI is a two-edged sword that brings risks and better yields. AI brings notable changes to firms' cybersecurity levels. Yet, enterprise leaders must recognize the critical risks it holds. Thus, skills upgrades for intense <b>vulnerability management</b> are a need of the hour.</br>

## Vulnerabilities & Business Risks without AI in Cybersecurity 

### 1. Authentication

Firms operate with complex systems that hold crucial data about business activities. Such systems operate within 100% encrypted walls that require user authentication to use the data. Yet, sometimes improper interventions, the presence of external threats, and unprofessional acts affect the user's authenticity.</br>

### 2. Malware Infection

Traditional cybersecurity methods failed to detect malware in the system. Firms deal with several software apps for diverse needs. Downloading malicious software or visiting risky sites causes malware infection. It enters the system and tries to steal official info, resulting in piracy attacks or data breaches. Loss of data, increasing expenses, and loss of credibility can be notable <b>business risks in cybersecurity</b>.</br>

### 3. Coding Bugs

Computing systems are complex to handle, and IT experts who run different codes at one time suffer the most. Running different codes in one interface creates complexities, causing security risks. Furthermore, it is impossible to accurately identify the source of the risk.</br>

### 4. Phishing

The most common cyber-attack that gets into the official database is through an employee’s credentials. System users face such threats if they unknowingly click on random links sent via emails or messages. As a result, firms may lose vital info to their rivals or hackers causing huge losses.</br>

In short, today’s digital space demands effective <b>vulnerability management</b>. Experts must adopt useful ways to get over these risks, and AI is one of them.</br>

## Vulnerabilities & Business Risks with AI in Cybersecurity   

### 1. Biased Business Decisions

Enterprise artificial intelligence is a collective effort of the machine and human instincts for a better future. Yet, relying too much on AI models can bring biased and discriminatory turns to decision-making. AI algorithms may need proper knowledge of business objectives. It results in biased remarks by leaders.</br>

### 2. Lack of Transparency

AI models are not 100% transparent while tracing security risks. Its presence can manipulate the real data, making it hard to interpret. A lack of transparency damage the reputation of firms with unreal business moves.</br>

### 3. Misuse of Systems

AI algorithms are complex, and working pros need to upskill to understand them. Due to the improper link of AI with existing systems, experts may need to be able to use the database and lag in detecting the right pattern.</br>

### 4. Privacy Risks

Today, firms rely mostly on AI models to deliver viable results and gain higher yields. For instance, ChatGPT can cause piracy attacks as it discloses personal user info to hackers. It gets easier for hackers to get into AI models and steal vital info, causing losses.</br>

In short, AI holds an impactful role in addressing the <b>business risks in cybersecurity</b>. It brings a quality change for firms and saves them from external risks. Yet, unethical use of AI models can degrade the potential gains.</br></br>

## In Conclusion,

<b>Artificial Intelligence in Cyber security</b> has become one of the intriguing topics today. Many firms from diverse sectors suffer a lot due to cyberattacks. Experts in cybersecurity roles find AI user-friendly, yet hard to discard the threats with better gains. Thus, upskilling with a proven AI program unlocks the path toward quality risk handling.</br>
