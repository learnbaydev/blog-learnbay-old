<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">ISRO Makes a History with GAGANYAAN Mission Powered by AI</span>
</br>

The revolutionary turn of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Indian space history has begun to gain notable victories. AI welcomes a paradigm shift in studying celestial bodies, lunar/solar surfaces, and the behaviour of galaxies. <b>AI in space exploration</b> attempts to help Indian scientists beat challenges in managing larger amounts of data.</br>

If we look back, AI’s journey in Indian space history started in 1959 with the ‘_Deep Space 1 Mission’_.The success stories of AI-powered space missions will bring _‘GAGANYAAN’_ into the limelight in 2023. AI and robotic systems take the position to set a milestone for <b>the</b> <b>Indian Space Research Organisation</b> (ISRO). This mission intends to send and bring back space astronauts safely from space.</br>

_<b>This blog will shed light on the empowering role of data and AI behind successful space projects –_</b> **GAGANYAAN**.</br></br>

## Data and AI Integration with Indian Space Missions

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/chandryan-one.png" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An image shows a spaceship outside the space employing various AI integration."/></br>

The rapid growth of data and AI in space missions empowers scientists with insightful moves. AI has become an inspiring future of Indian space missions, bringing automated navigation to robotic monitoring into the limelight. Recent _Chandrayaan-3_ success reflects the notable part played by data and AI. Even _Gaganyaan_ sets a journey for an unmanned spacecraft mission paving the way for an automated space future.</br>

ISRO’s approach to bringing a humanoid system into space missions is directed toward a promising digital shift. Its ability to read and speak eases space missions in India. Data and AI-powered tools are helping space teams have better solutions. AI-based solutions help see through complex data sets, predict the threats before time, and offer faster responses, constant communication, and reporting.</br>

_<b>Let’s learn more about the role of data and AI in Gaganyaan.</b>_</br></br>

## Data & AI Controlling the Indian Space Missions – A Dive Into **GAGANYAAN Mission**

ISRO welcomes data and AI with a commitment to have reliable space missions with effective solutions. Gaganyaan is the reflection of this intent, paving the way for an AI-driven space exploration journey.</br>

_<b>The following sections will focus on the usefulness of data and AI models in space missions.</b>_

_<b>Also read: <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/significance-of-data-analytics-in-advancing-indian-space-exploration-endeavours" target="_blank">How Data Analytics Is Crucial for India's Space Missions?</a></b>_</br>

### Crew Escape System

The advent of data and AI in Indian space missions has always focused on the safety of the astronauts. Gaganyaan aims to send astronauts to low orbit Earth space to bring them back. Indian astronauts face continuous threats from starting the mission to having a safe landing. The _‘Crew Escape System’_ is designed to tackle such safety risks. This system uses AI tools and techniques to control the threats with insightful solutions.</br>

<b>AI in space exploration</b> is directed toward the use of safety systems that freely navigate the spacecraft in the right way. The crew escape system consists of a high/low altitude and jettisoning motors that limit the safety risks of astronauts and land them safely. Integrating data and AI tools, the system communicates facts about emergencies or upcoming threats in space.</br>

The _<b>Indian Space Agency</b>_ pledges to tackle space threats with actionable solutions. The AI algorithms and machine learning models help space scientists get timely info on spacecraft movement and offer solutions. The infusion of a crew escape system builds a secured platform to keep the vehicle and astronauts safe.</br>

### Quick Responsiveness to Space Challenges

The <b>Gaganyaan mission</b> takes a deep dive into the space threats that often limit the success of space projects. ISRO launched the test vehicle (TV-D1) designed as a single-stage rocket. AI models control the vehicle and linked systems. Astronauts interact with data-driven insights with teams for better space exploration and efficient results.</br>

Space teams often experience glitches that slow down the missions and other operations. Even during the test vehicle launch, AI systems offered automated solutions, navigating a successful mission. The deployment of AI models helps astronauts and teams detect anomalies, prevent defects, and lessen risks. AI-powered solutions offer faster responses to spacecraft risks affecting astronauts.</br>

### Humanoid Robot for Seamless Space Operations

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/chandryan-two.png" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An image shows a humanoid robot using and pointing to a screen."/></br>

Vyommitra enters the sphere of <b>space technology in India</b> as a humanoid robot. ISRO is progressing toward designing its astronauts for space missions that are in the training phase. Vyommitra is the first attempt that focuses on offering seamless space operations. The humanoid system enables space teams to operate smoothly without risk or delay.</br>

_<b>The system is liable to help with –</b>_

- _Monitoring parameters of the modules_</br>
- _Detecting and informing risks_</br>
- _Designing life-saving functions_</br>
- _Assisting astronauts and other team members_</br>
- _Addressing inquiries_</br>
- _Ensuring safe landing_</br>
- _Team communication_</br>
- _Ensuring the safety and reliability of the operating systems_</br>

In short, ISRO brings Vyommitra as a supportive system or assistant for astronauts with better abilities. Soon, humanoid systems will take control of space missions and represent astronauts, limiting the life threats.</br></br>

## In a Nutshell,

<b>Indian Space Research Organisation</b> (ISRO) takes the pledge of changing the future of space missions. Its attempt to integrate Data and AI undoubtedly ensures a reliable and secure future India has signed agreements with many global space organizations concerning the bright future to import quality equipment. ISRO aims to make the best use of the resources and equipment available from foreign entities. ISRO sets a target of having a fully operating space station by the end of 2035. Such targets and success stories highlight the rising demand for data and AI experts in the space industry.</br>

Concerning the changing digital landscape, space experts (astronauts, space scientists, engineers, etc.) must upgrade their skill sets with AI trends.
