<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">Data Structures and Algorithms Driving Career Success in Real!!</span> <br/>

<b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b> are important if you have ever prepared for a technical interview with a big tech giant like IBM, Microsoft, Google, etc. It is certain that to crack tech interviews at top-tier MNCs, you must be well-versed in DSA concepts and practical uses. Recruiters or employers assess your skills based on the depth of DSA knowledge.</br>

The rise of computing systems takes control of today’s businesses worldwide. Following this, data-driven culture takes a significant position across industries to drive success rates higher than ever. The software industry sees a challenge here – _‘arranging datasets for easy access and quality analysis’_. Here, DSA comes into the limelight.</br>

A grounded knowledge of DSA concepts helps programmers or other IT experts have real-time use in projects. Especially the software pros eager to drive career growth and better job offers find DSA skills vital. Enrolling in a <b>data structure and algorithms course</b> can unlock infinite career opportunities with proven skills.</br>

_<b>This blog will discuss real-life success stories highlighting DSA skills in mending a successful career graph.</b>_

_<b>Now, let’s understand DSA.</b>_</br>

## What do you mean by Data Structure and Algorithm?

Data structure conceptualizes data arrangement using tools like a stack, linked list, and many more. A computer system holds a database with vast amounts of data. Yet, having accurate access to them becomes challenging for experts. Basic knowledge of data structure helps experts store and arrange data in an order. The use of binary search trees helps experts arrange data orderly in the system and prioritize them.</br>

On the other hand, an algorithm devises a set of instructions to solve any problem in the system. Such instructions are easy to understand, and experts convert them into programming languages for better execution.</br></br>

## Real-life Success Stories of Experts After Embracing DSA Skills

DSA has become one of the promising skills for software pros. More than basic knowledge of programming languages is required to face business issues and tackle them. Thus, working pros must take a step to upgrade their skills with DSA principles and concepts. DSA expertise unlocks endless career growth scope and attractive benefits.</br>

Let us dive deeper into some real-life success stories of software experts with DSA skills from top-tier tech companies. These stories will shed light on career shifts experts witnessed after refining their skill sets with DSA.</br>

### 1. A Case of Uber Project

Years ago, Uber started working on its mobile application development project. The project had to undergo many changes in mobile architecture to have seamless functioning. Uber’s mobile architecture is built on the RIBs(Router, Interactor, and Builder) framework that handles multiple apps.</br>

Yet, the software experts with this project needed help in visualizing the elements due to an inefficient router; RIBs failed to process the operations smoothly. This resulted in increasing customer queries and degrading remarks for the mobile apps.</br>

Then, Uber appointed skilled software experts with DSA skills. The use of tree structures with RIBs presented factors in a hierarchical data structure as shown in _figure_ 1 _below_.</br>

An app consists of many pages, one after the other. The _tree structure_ in DSA helps experts place each element in a hierarchy so that the user gets direct access. RIBs tree structure helps experts detach or attach elements that reflect a seamless user experience.</br>

Experts with DSA knowledge helped Uber’s mobile app become successful in _state management_. The functions of login, request for a ride, on a trip, OTP access, etc., were possible with DSA skills that control state transitions with RIBs.</br>

_Figures 2 & 3_ above show completed trip data and predicted trip data respectively, helping Uber experts in managing state transitions.</br>

### 2. A Case of Skyscanner Project

Skyscanner faced a critical problem in _caching, crawling, and managing increasing web loads_. Skyscanner is useful for bringing cheap tickets for passengers. Most importantly, in multi-city planning terms, Skyscanner faced issues in deciding the shortest routes with less cost charged.
</br>

The tech team faced many issues in tracing and designing the best possible path for destinations. Then, Skyscanner restructured its IT team with skilled experts with DSA skills who helped the firm with better solutions. The team used _shortest-path algorithms_ that projected the best deals for passengers. The _graph structure_ designed the best paths connecting prime destinations at the cheapest prices.</br>

_“A\*” Search Algorithm_ conducts a comparative analysis between different flight charges and selects the best one. The team with proven DSA skills helped Skyscanner overcome the issues and handle website loading time.</br>

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/Real-Life.PNG" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An image shows predicted trip data of Uber with variables like, 'completed trips', 'app views', 'riders', 'temperature', 'wind speed', and 'wind bearing'. This data along with DSA helps Uber in state management."/> <br/>

These examples state that DSA skills help software experts handle critical cases and overcome hurdles smoothly. _Uber’s Web Crypto_ is another familiar case where tech experts used their DSA skills to build an encrypted interface to protect user-sensitive data.</br>

Apart from corporate projects, many software professionals contributed to their professional growth. Basic DSA skills and expertise helped IT experts drive career growth and success in diverse fields. Experts learning in a <b>data structure and algorithm course</b> can apply their skills better and bring wise solutions.</br>

Many software pros opt for proven upskilling with DSA programs that help them shed career redundancies. Learning DSA helps in efficient coding, solving issues with realistic options, and building a seamless future.</br>
