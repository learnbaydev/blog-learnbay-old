<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">Data Visualization Trends Complements Storytelling!!</span> <br/>

_Have you ever wondered why academic books contain visual analysis of theories defined? Why do learners find colorful academic books more engaging than lengthy teaching notes?_

These indicate the emotional connections of readers with the contents. Undoubtedly, visuals are more interactive than words. Audiences can emotionally connect with visuals or stories rather than phrases. Sometimes, visuals depict facts easily that words fail to convey. Likewise, data experts follow <b>data visualization trends</b> to interpret actionable insights.

Working experts in the data field know the value of visuals. In technical terms, visuals indicate data visualization. It does the same that academic book visuals did earlier. It conveys insights in the form of graphs, charts, or some other visuals. But visuals are useful only if they are conveyed well. Here, storytelling comes into the limelight. Data experts cannot read out the facts just with numbers; it needs proper storytelling.

_This blog will discuss trending data visualization ways that consider storytelling for <b>visualizing trends in information</b>._

## Data Visualization Tactics to Consider in 2024

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/data_v.png" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An image shows data visualization trends using various bar graphs, charts, and pie charts."/></br>

Here, you will learn about _<b>data visualization trends 2024,</b>_ which will take your decision-making to the next level.

### 1. Crafting Audience-Specific Data Visuals

Creating an audience-oriented visual is the first tip here. It means a data expert must see the abilities of team members before designing visuals or presentations. A team may consist of tech and non-tech audiences. Thus, presenting visuals with crystal clear content helps viewers understand the insights.

Experts must use <b>storytelling with data</b> visuals to craft insights. Before that, they must completely know and understand their audiences. Viewers from non-science or IT fields may need to help understand statistical terms. Thus, one must try to know the skill limits of their audiences and present the facts accordingly.

**For example –** You are a Research Analyst and are asked to present facts on increasing rates of plant-based food consumption. Stacked graphs show the patterns and trends over the years, confusing the context. Stacked graphs provide uncertain visuals that make it hard for experts to see gaps between variables. In contrast, bar charts deliver simple results. Horizontal bar charts can show patterns with percentages to know the insights better. Experts can depict personal stories or consumer reviews while presenting the graphs and charts.

### 2. Pick the Right Visual Effects/types Concerning the Story

Data visualization is a way to depict insights to make the viewers move. The data expert must see through the facts and choose the right visual type. Experts must select the right yet simple visual effects and chart/graph type. Bar graphs are common for comparative analysis insights. Line graphs showcase simple and clear data trends with specific results.

Experts must learn <b>creative data presentation techniques</b> to deliver a pictorial view of instances. A combination of numbers and facts backed up with personal stories makes the interpretation useful. Using histograms or pie charts can confuse the viewers and cover up the facts to a certain extent. Hence, choosing the right visual types or effects is vital for experts.

**For example –** If you convey the facts related to rising unemployment in India, you must use bar graphs with proper percentages of employed and unemployed people. Short stories about the reasons behind unemployment can help viewers understand the trend well.

### 3. Opt for a Simple Storytelling Visualization over Numbers  

Audiences engage with the facts that use short stories rather than statistics. Many decision-makers belong to non-tech fields with little or no statistics knowledge. Thus, presenting a simple story concerning the extracted insights can do wonders.

The storytelling approach can break down complex facts in simpler terms. Data visualization tools like Power BI help experts find data trends and patterns. Yet, that is not enough for decision-makers to make a move. In contrast, visual elements craft the insights engagingly, reaching millions of people. The gridlines, charts, graphs, etc, confuse the viewers and restrict them from finding a solution.

**For example–** You are a marketing analyst presenting facts for a new product launch (fast-food item). You opt for 3D graphs to present insights on increasing sales trends for fast-food products. The graph can confuse the viewers if they fail to decode the links between variables. A simple graph with facts and stories can make a wise move. Here, experts can express the <b>visualizing trends in information</b>. It shall contain –

- _Key Pointers_
- _Labeling_
- _Sales Trends with Accurate Figures_
- _Key Competitors_
- _New Product Positioning_

### 4. Understand the Psychic Pressure of Audiences

<b>Data visualization trends</b> in 2024 showcase many tricks to control audience behavior. Viewers see, understand, and grasp the facts as per their cognitive abilities. Data experts must have the skill to reduce confusion and match their viewers. If your message is complex and hard to understand, viewers may fail to make a better decision. Opting for storytelling tricks can motivate the viewers and engage them longer.

Experts can use simple charts or visuals to relax the viewers. Complex visuals can divert their attention, and they may miss the facts. Experts must choose the text size, color, elements, and styles wisely to make the visuals simpler and interactive. Experts must use <b>creative data presentation techniques</b> wisely to enhance the quality of their insights.

**For example –** If you have larger data sets to present, you can opt for simple bar graphs with minimal color effects. If you have smaller data to convey, then try to avoid graphs/charts. Summarize the data in simple texts and add your personalized stories to reach wider audiences.

### 5. Present the Facts Through Inspiring Stories

<b>Storytelling with data</b> gathers more audiences. Experts can present the facts by engaging in short stories from their past project experience. Storytelling is the best practice to persuade the audience to understand the facts. It decreases the misleading part of data visuals. Experts presenting facts with evidential stories level up their credibility.

**For example –** Experts can break down larger data sets into smaller groups and come up with stories accordingly. It simplifies the viewers' focus to a certain point to see through the facts. Experts can make a fictional story or share personal experiences to present insights.
