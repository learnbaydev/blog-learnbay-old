<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/ds-vs-cd.png" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An image shows two data enthusiasts. one working on a laptop and the other standing in front of chart."/></br>

## Data Science & **Data Engineering** in Brief!!

Data Science is a holistic field that consists of everything – from sourcing data to making informed decisions. Firms find this field helpful for tackling issues with facts in hand and making insightful moves. _Data scientist's jobs expect to grow by 35% by 2032_. Thus, the <b>best degree for data science</b> concentrates more on skills upgrades to meet the increasing demands.</br>

**Data Engineering** deals with cleaning and arranging the raw data sets to help seniors make the right move. Data engineers help other data experts find insights, make decisions, and plan business growth. _The data engineering market expects a rise of 36.7% by 2027, welcoming data experts in diverse fields_. Thus, experts eager to start their careers as data engineers must opt for an industry-paced course.</br></br>

## Uncovering Data Science vs. Data Engineering  

Data scientists and data engineers are essential for business success, yet inherent distinctions bring diverse results for experts. So, let us review the major differences between these two roles that will help you make the right career decision.</br>

### 1. Based on Educational Requirements

Learners eager to pursue data science or <b>data engineering</b> must hold a bachelor’s degree in any discipline with good academic records. A basic knowledge of mathematics or statistics makes them good at making analytic decisions. A knowledge of programming languages is an extra gain but not mandatory. In short, both fields welcome learners from diverse domains.</br>

### 2. Based on Roles and Responsibilities

Learners opting for the data science field aim to drive their careers as data scientists. Their role is to extract insights from raw data sets and help decision-makers make the right move. Their knowledge of statistics helps in experiments, visualize, identify trends, analyze patterns, and make predictions.</br>

**Data engineering** crafts a successful career for data engineers with the primary role of designing data frameworks for analysis. Pursuing a proven course program helps learners deal with raw data sets, data storage, and security. They are helping hand to data scientists. They provide structured data sets to data scientists for further analysis and decision-making. Their skill in designing seamless data pipelines leads to quality data analysis.</br>

### 3. Based on Skill Sets

Upskilling from the <b>best online data science masters</b> program equips a learner with basic knowledge of programming languages (_Python, SQL_). Plus, it enriches their careers with skill sets in – Statistical models, AI & ML algorithms, data visualization, big data tools (_Spark, Hadoop_), and forecasting models (_Time-series_).</br>

A learner eager to become a skilled data engineer can learn basic programming (_SQL_), database management, data warehouse, and big data (_Spark, Hadoop_) skills via upskilling.</br>

### 4. Based on Earning Potential & Job Opportunities

A review of a <b>data scientist vs. data engineer</b> <b>salary in India</b> interprets the earning potential and job offers available for these roles.</br>

Pursuing the <b>best degree for data science</b> unlocks job offers in India and overseas with exponential growth. The average salary for a data scientist is ₹13,50,000 pa. Data scientists can rebuild global careers with quality learning and hands-on practice with trending tools. A notable degree enriches their careers with job offers from overseas (_US, Canada, Europe, and 60+ Western countries_).</br>

Data engineers earn ₹10,50,000 a year in India. Yet, their roles are limited, and they do not see much growth. Some firms hire data scientists, which includes the duties of data engineers. The increasing demand for decision-making skills of data experts may slow the pace of the growth of data engineers in the next years.</br>

### 5. Based on Career Path

Data scientist's career advancement ranges from entry-level to senior managing positions. It's an open platform that helps in the skills upgrade of experts for better growth & success.</br>

**Data engineering** crafts a career path that has become limited and does not have much scope at entry levels. Also, many MNCs see the data engineer’s role as a data architect, developer, or any other software engineer. In short, more privilege for tech domain experts lessens the growth scope for non-tech pros.</br>

I am summing up the comparison in a table for ease of understanding.</br>
